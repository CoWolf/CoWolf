      CoWolf allows you to create architecture models and multiple QoS models of the same system. It also allows you to develop transformations between the models to help the evolution. Moreover CoWolf supports you keeping multiple models consistent whenever they evolve. CoWolf also integrates verification frameworks for QoS models.
